                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>I'm a Web developer who loves to build experiences that help others do what they couldn't do before.
                    I
                    was exposed to those huge computer
                    systems at a
                    considerably very young age. My father, an electronics engineer by
                    profession, used to make me build projects, and I was always interested in the hardware aspect of
                    computers
                    which made
                    me build my personal computers on my own and I would proudly say that I have never reached out to a
                    computer
                    technician
                    when something breaks in my computer. Which eventually made me pursue electronics and communication
                    engineering
                    in my
                    bachelors. However, I realised my interests are inclined towards the software aspect of computers. I
                    started
                    learning to
                    code when I was 19 years because I wanted to make my own video games. Over time, I have gained a
                    wealth of
                    experience
                    designing and developing web applications.</p>
